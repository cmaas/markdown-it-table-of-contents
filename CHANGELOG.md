## [Unreleased]

## [0.8.0] - 2024-09-10

## [0.7.0] - 2024-09-09

* **Added:** Override the container element
* ⚠️ **BREAKING CHANGE:** The plugin moved from *inline mode* to *block mode* (fixes #62)
* **Changed:** Updated tests, readme etc.
* **Removed:** Old forceFullToc attribute

## Override the container element

Two new options that accept functions that return HTML to render custom containers (and more elements if necessary):

```js
md.use(markdownItTOC, {
    transformContainerOpen: () => {
        return '<nav class="my-toc"><button>Toggle</button><h3>Table of Contents</h3>';
    },
    transformContainerClose: () => {
        return '</nav>';
    }
});
```

## Inline mode is now block mode

Input:

```md
[[toc]]
```

**Output before:**

```html
<p><div class="table-of-contents"></div></p>
```

**Output now:**

```html
<div class="table-of-contents"></div>
```

The TOC now is generated in block mode, which removes the wrapping `p` tag. Wrapping a `div` in a `p` is considered invalid HTML.

If you really need a wrapping p-element, you can emulate the old behavior with the new container override functions:

```js
const md = new MarkdownIt();
md.use(markdownItTOC, {
    transformContainerOpen: () => {
        return '<p><div class="table-of-contents">';
    },
    transformContainerClose: () => {
        return '</div></p>';
    }
});
```

Be aware that the old tests/examples now behave differently when using soft breaks before the [[toc]] markup:

Input:

```md
# Article
Text with soft line break (two spaces)  
[[toc]]

## Headline
```

**Output before:**

```md
<h1>Article</h1>
<p>Text with soft line break (two spaces)<br>
<div class="table-of-contents">...</div></p>
```

**Output now:**

```md
<h1>Article</h1>
<p>Text with soft line break (two spaces)</p>
<div class="table-of-contents">...</div>
```

## [0.6.0] - 2021-11-12

The TOC generator was rewritten, because the old *on-the-fly* generator couldn't deal with unexpected order of headings and double-indentations. It is now a three-step process:

1. Gather all headings in a list.
2. Turn that list into a nested tree.
3. Generate HTML code based on the nested tree.

Although all tests pass, this release could introduce some **breaking changes** for you, if you relied on the old way of doing things. Check the test cases to get a better understanding how this plugin handles various cases.

* **Added**: Support for `markdown-it-attrs` (fixes #54)
* **Changed**: Respects unexpected nesting order (fixes #55)
* **Changed**: Uses anchor targets from existing id attributes (for example, set by `markdown-it-attrs` or `markdown-it-anchor`)
* **Changed**: Now nests list correctly if there is a jump (for example: h2, h2, h4 -> h4 is now double-indented)
* **Removed**: unused tests
